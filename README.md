# StarkMarkFinal
#description
#the program is a sample of a future project which is StartMark, the final idea of StartMark is to create an app for students in which they can apply for short-term 
jobs and comapgny could recruit.
In this code we tried to simulate an event where there would be up to 11 students signing up on a laptop, there is possibility to set the number of students that 
can sign up too a maximum of 11. There are a total of 5 compagnies that are from 5 different job sections: Restaurant, Store, Bar, Office and Club. For students they will input their information and job desires and compagnies will be able to see the data of students that desire to woirk in their sectors.
