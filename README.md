# StarkMarkFinal
#description
#the program is a sample of a future project which is StartMark, the final idea of StartMark is to create an app for students in which they can apply for short-term  jobs and comapgny could recruit.
In this code we tried to simulate an event where there would be up to 11 students signing up on a laptop, where up to 11 students can sign up for a job demand on the available 5 compagnies. There are a total of 5 compagnies that are from 5 different job sections: Restaurant, Store, Bar, Office and Club. For students they will input their information and job desired and compagnies will be able to see the data of students that desire to work in their sectors. The students point will work based on how many people want to sign up and input the information through the console. The inputs of students will be used to create a graph which will be used later for comapgnies to see the demand of student for their compagny. The append of node will be added automatically through the input of job, Also a hash table will be created with this inputs that will be exported to an CSV file where all the students information would be stored. The way that compagny will be able to acces their data is through the input of their code given: # 4789 for Office, 4930 for Restaurantm 9459 for Bar, 3080 for Club and 7899 for Store. It will show the data based on the nodes fromed in the graph. The future idea is to implement this on a cloud server so student can apply so through their own laptop

#instalation:
simply open the file on a pycharm plateform, no requirements to download addtional libraries.

#Usage: 
For the usage, you run thhe program on a python plateform such as Pycharm, you follow the instruction on the console of pycharm and type in the input mentioned in the text to use different options of program and type the input corretly letter per letter if different options are written. Two main tips to use the program is to read the text in the console and type the input in the consol based on what is asked.
